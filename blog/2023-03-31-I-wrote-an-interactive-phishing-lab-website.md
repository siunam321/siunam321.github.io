## Background

In my [Higher Diploma in Cybersecurity at Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (IVE)](https://www.vtc.edu.hk/admission/en/programme/it114122-higher-diploma-in-cybersecurity/), there is a curriculum called "Whole Person Development - Collaboration, Teamwork & Social Engagement" (SDD4006), which requires student to conduct a group project aimed at "How young people can learn from cyberattacks and develop good practices in cybersecurity." by achieving one of the United Nations (UN)'s [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) (SDG). After some discussions with group members, we decided to build a website that teaches people about phishing attacks through an interactive lab.

## What did I learned?

During the website building process, I learned about both back-end and front-end skills, such as the basics of PHP, including how to connect to a MySQL database via PHP's [MySQLi](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php) (MySQL Improved Extension). I also gained a better understanding of basic JavaScript, [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX) (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML), and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Aside from technical skills, I learned how to communicate with people, such as evaluating different ideas with groupmates and presenting content to an audience.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project taught me a lot, including technical and verbal skills.
