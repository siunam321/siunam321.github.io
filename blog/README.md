> Back in November 2024, me and my university CTF team [NuttyShell](https://polyuctf.com/) placed champion on [PwC's Darklab Hack A Day CTF competition](https://www.pwchk.com/en/issues/cybersecurity-and-privacy/hack-a-day/competitions-2024.html). One of the champion prizes is "Sponsorship of Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) PEN-200 certification (90-day lab access)". Since [I already earned OSCP](https://credentials.offsec.com/a191a6a5-1a16-426e-b6a6-726ba540cfb6#acc.KgkJy98U) back in 2023, and having a strong interest in web security, I requested the organizer to switch it to [OffSec Web Expert (OSWE)](https://www.offsec.com/courses/web-300/), which they happily did so!

> In my [Higher Diploma in Cybersecurity at Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (IVE)](https://www.vtc.edu.hk/admission/en/programme/it114122-higher-diploma-in-cybersecurity/), there is a curriculum called "Whole Person Development - Collaboration, Teamwork & Social Engagement" (SDD4006), which requires student to conduct a group project aimed at "How young people can learn from cyberattacks and develop good practices in cybersecurity." by achieving one of the United Nations (UN)'s [Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) (SDG).
